= Flow: fast directory/project switcher

== Installation

For macOS users:

[source,sh]
====
brew tap babariviere/tools
brew install babariviere/tools/flow-sh
====

The brewfile is named `flow-sh` since `flow` already exists in homebrew/core.

== Usage

To use it, add this in your `.zshrc` (bash support is not here for now):

[source,sh]
====
# Replace ~/src with your root project directory
eval $(flow setup "~/src")
====

See <<hierarchy>> to see how the files will be created.

=== Neovim

This project has a neovim plugin to have fast project switching.

You can find it here: https://github.com/babariviere/flow.nvim
