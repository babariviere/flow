== Installation

For macOS users:

[source,sh]
----
brew tap babariviere/tools
brew install babariviere/tools/flow-sh
----

The brewfile is named `flow-sh` since `flow` already exists in homebrew/core.

== Usage

To use it, add this in your `.zshrc` (bash support is not here for now):

[source,sh]
----
# Replace ~/src with your root project directory
eval $(flow setup "~/src")
----

See <<hierarchy>> to see how the files will be created.

Plugins:

- Neovim: https://github.com/babariviere/flow.nvim

=== Commands

You can also use this tool to pipe into other commands. For this, we have multiple commands.

[source,sh]
----
# Search for a visited file or a project
flow search baba flow

# Search for a project
flow search --project baba flow

# Clone a project and print his path
flow clone babariviere/flow
flow clone gh:babariviere/flow # set github as a source (it's the default so you can omit the `gh:`)
----

==== Example

Search for a folder:

[source,sh]
----
$ flow search flow src
~/src/github.com/babariviere/flow/src
----
